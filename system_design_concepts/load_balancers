what?
a device or software that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers.
it ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed.
it optimizes resource use
it maximizes throughput (i.e. the amount of data or no. of transactions processeed by a system within a given time frame.)
it minimizes response time
it ensures high availability

types
- hardware
- software like ngnix
- cloud-base like amazon ELB

LB algorithms
- round robin - directs trafic to the servers sequentially
    weighted round robin- servers are given weights, and traffic is distribution as per the servers' wait
- IP/URL hash - directs traffic based on the ip idress
- Least COnnections - directs traffic to server with list comprehension.
