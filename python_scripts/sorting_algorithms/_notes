Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
it repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
*it bubbles through the list.
KEY_PHRASE: IT BUBBLES UP THE LARGEST ELEMENTS

Selection sort divides the array into sorted and unsorted parts.
it repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted parts
and moves it to the sorted part.

Insertion sort builds a sorted array (or list) one element at a time
it does this by comparing the current element to the sorted elements,
and inserting it in its correct position.
