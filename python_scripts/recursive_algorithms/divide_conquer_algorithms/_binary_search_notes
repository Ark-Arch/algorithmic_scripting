practical applications or variants that rely on the principles of binary seach.

*these principles include:
- halving the seach space
- managing pointers
- performing binary searches on a solution space

1. finding an element in a sorted array
2. seach insert position
3. finding first or last occurrence
4. finding peak element (unimodal search)
5. square root calculation
6. rotated sorted array search
7. finding minimum or maximum in a rotated sorted array
8. binary search on answer
9. searching in infinite-sized arrays
10. Kth smallest/Largest element
